Video poker is a casino game based on five-card draw poker. It is played on a computerized console similar in size to a slot machine. "Jacks or Better," sometimes called "Draw Poker", is the most common variation of video poker. Payoffs begin at a pair of jacks. So here is the online version of it that I created with HTML CSS JS.</h3>
